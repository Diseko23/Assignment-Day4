3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is a process which gives a team a margin of flexibility at each stage and allow them to change the course of a project and incorporate new feedback.
Advantage: It is iterative and flexible, adapting to changes.
Disadvantages: The flexibilty of this model comes with costs  and one of the main set back is lack of long-term planning.
Waterfall is a stict, more linear methodology which limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages.
Advantate: It is effective for smaller projects with a well-defined requirements 
Disadvantafge: It is nit flexible, lacks feedback and the model is dependent on the upfront planning and design. 

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile can focus on large and small projects, it is flexible and can adapt to change, this means there can be changes at any stage of the project using the Agile methodology. While the waterall it is stricted, it is not flexible, and limit the team to to diverse from the plan to another stage. This model it is good ffor small projects.

5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Ensuring quality in sohftware projects includes approaches such as testing products, code reviews, clear requirements and continuos integration.

9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution
By outlining the problem, set clear requrements and do aresearch on the problems to find better solutions.
